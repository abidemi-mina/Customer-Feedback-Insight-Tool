My name is Adebowale Abidemi Aminat, and I am currently in my final year as a Computer Science student at Afe Babalola University. I’ve spent my undergraduate years evolving into a web developer and AI researcher, with my sights firmly set on a career as an AI Engineer. I believe that technology shouldn't just be about writing code; it should be about building tools that solve real human frustrations.

The Spark Behind the Project
The inspiration for Customer Insight AI came from observing the struggles of local business owners. I noticed a recurring problem: entrepreneurs are often buried under a mountain of feedback from social media, emails, and reviews. While they want to improve, they simply don’t have the hours to manually read every comment, identify patterns, and figure out a strategic way forward.

I wanted to build a "digital consultant" a tool that doesn't just display data but actually understands it. I wanted to create a system where a business owner could upload messy, unorganized feedback and receive a clear, prioritized roadmap for growth.

Bringing the Vision to Life
To make this practical and scalable, I chose a modern, high-performance stack that prioritizes cross-platform accessibility:

The Foundation: I used Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) to ensure the app runs natively on both Android and Desktop.

The Brain: I integrated Google’s Gemini AI (using the Flash models) to handle the complex task of sentiment analysis and generating actionable business advice.

The Infrastructure: I implemented SQLDelight for reliable, type-safe local storage and Ktor for seamless communication with the AI APIs.

The Interface: Using Compose Multiplatform, I built a UI that is clean and intuitive, making complex data easy to digest for any user.

Looking Ahead
This project is more than an academic requirement; it’s a reflection of my commitment to accessible AI. As I prepare to graduate, I am excited to continue developing solutions that bridge the gap between advanced research and practical, real-world impact
